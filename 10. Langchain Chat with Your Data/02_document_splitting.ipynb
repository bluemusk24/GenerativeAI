       "(\"of this class will not be very program ming intensive, although we will do some \\nprogramming, mostly in either MATLAB or Octa ve. I'll say a bit more about that later.  \\nI also assume familiarity with basic proba bility and statistics. So most undergraduate \\nstatistics class, like Stat 116 taught here at Stanford, will be more than enough. I'm gonna \\nassume all of you know what ra ndom variables are, that all of you know what expectation \\nis, what a variance or a random variable is. And in case of some of you, it's been a while \\nsince you've seen some of this material. At some of the discussion sections, we'll actually \\ngo over some of the prerequisites, sort of as  a refresher course under prerequisite class. \\nI'll say a bit more about that later as well.  \\nLastly, I also assume familiarity with basi c linear algebra. And again, most undergraduate \\nlinear algebra courses are more than enough. So if you've taken courses like Math 51, \\n103, Math 113 or CS205 at Stanford, that would be more than enough. Basically, I'm \\ngonna assume that all of you know what matrix es and vectors are, that you know how to \\nmultiply matrices and vectors and multiply matrix and matrices, that you know what a matrix inverse is. If you know what an eigenvect or of a matrix is, that'd be even better. \\nBut if you don't quite know or if you're not qu ite sure, that's fine, too. We'll go over it in \\nthe review sections.  \\nSo there are a couple more logisti cal things I should deal with in  this class. One is that, as \\nmost of you know, CS229 is a televised cla ss. And in fact, I guess many of you are \\nprobably watching this at home on TV, so I' m gonna say hi to our home viewers.  \\nSo earlier this year, I appro ached SCPD, which televises th ese classes, about trying to \\nmake a small number of Stanford classes publ icly available or posting the videos on the \\nweb. And so this year, Stanford is actually starting a small pilot program in which we'll \\npost videos of a small number of classes onlin e, so on the Internet in a way that makes it \\npublicly accessible to everyone. I'm very exc ited about that because machine learning in \\nschool, let's get the word out there.  \\nOne of the consequences of this is that — let's see — so videos  or pictures of the students \\nin this classroom will not be posted online, so your images — so don't worry about being \\nby seeing your own face appear on YouTube one day. But the microphones may pick up your voices, so I guess the consequence of that is that because microphones may pick up your voices, no matter how irritated you are at  me, don't yell out swear words in the \\nmiddle of class, but because there won't be video you can safely sit there and make faces \\nat me, and that won't show, okay?  \\nLet's see. I also handed out this — ther e were two handouts I hope most of you have, \\ncourse information handout. So let me just sa y a few words about parts of these. On the \\nthird page, there's a section that says Online Resources.  \\nOh, okay. Louder? Actually, could you turn up the volume? Testing. Is this better? \\nTesting, testing. Okay, cool. Thanks.  \",\n",
       " \"So all right, online resources. The class has a home page, so it's in on the handouts. I \\nwon't write on the chalkboard — http:// cs229.stanford.edu. And so when there are \\nhomework assignments or things like that, we  usually won't sort of — in the mission of \\nsaving trees, we will usually not give out many handouts in class. So homework \\nassignments, homework solutions will be posted online at the course home page.  \\nAs far as this class, I've also written, a nd I guess I've also revised every year a set of \\nfairly detailed lecture notes that cover the te chnical content of this  class. And so if you \\nvisit the course homepage, you'll also find the detailed lecture notes that go over in detail \\nall the math and equations and so on  that I'll be doing in class.  \\nThere's also a newsgroup, su.class.cs229, also written on the handout. This is a \\nnewsgroup that's sort of a forum for people in  the class to get to  know each other and \\nhave whatever discussions you want to ha ve amongst yourselves. So the class newsgroup \\nwill not be monitored by the TAs and me. But this is a place for you to form study groups \\nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored \\nby the TAs and me. So feel free to ta lk trash about this class there.  \\nIf you want to contact the teaching staff, pl ease use the email address written down here, \\ncs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. This goes to an acc ount that's read by all the TAs and me. So \\nrather than sending us email individually, if you send email to this account, it will \\nactually let us get back to you maximally quickly with answers to your questions.  \\nIf you're asking questions about homework probl ems, please say in the subject line which \\nassignment and which question the email refers to, since that will also help us to route \\nyour question to the appropriate TA or to me  appropriately and get the response back to \\nyou quickly.  \\nLet's see. Skipping ahead — let's see — for homework, one midterm, one open and term \\nproject. Notice on the honor code. So one thi ng that I think will help you to succeed and \\ndo well in this class and even help you to enjoy this cla ss more is if you form a study \\ngroup.  \\nSo start looking around where you' re sitting now or at the end of class today, mingle a \\nlittle bit and get to know your classmates. I strongly encourage you to form study groups \\nand sort of have a group of people to study with and have a group of your fellow students \\nto talk over these concepts with. You can also  post on the class news group if you want to \\nuse that to try to form a study group.  \\nBut some of the problems sets in this cla ss are reasonably difficult.  People that have \\ntaken the class before may tell you they were very difficult. And just I bet it would be \\nmore fun for you, and you'd probably have a be tter learning experience if you form a \\nstudy group of people to work with. So I definitely encourage you to do that.  \\nAnd just to say a word on the honor code, whic h is I definitely en courage you to form a \\nstudy group and work together, discuss homew ork problems together. But if you discuss \")"
