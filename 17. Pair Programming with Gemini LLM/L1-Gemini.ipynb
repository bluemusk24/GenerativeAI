      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "my_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Iterate and print each item\n",

      "    print(f\"Item at index {i}: {item}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The first example directly iterates through each element in `my_list`, assigning it to the variable `item` in each iteration.\n",
      "* The second example uses `enumerate()`, which provides both the index (`i`) and the value (`item`) of each element during iteration.  `f-strings` (formatted string literals) are used for cleaner output.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Using a `while` loop:** This offers more control, but is generally less concise for simple list iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "my_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",

      "* The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the list.\n",

      "\n",

      "**3. List comprehension (for creating new lists):** While not strictly iteration *in* the list, list comprehensions are a concise way to create a new list based on an existing one.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* List comprehensions create a new list by applying an expression to each item in the original list (optionally with a conditional filter).\n",
      "\n",

      "**1. Using a `for` loop:** This is the most common and generally preferred method for iterating through a list.\n",
