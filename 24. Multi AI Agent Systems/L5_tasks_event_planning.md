# L5: Automate Event Planning

In this lesson, you will learn more about Tasks.

The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
```Python
!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```


```python
# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

- Import libraries, APIs and LLM


```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
```

**Note**: 
- The video uses `gpt-4-turbo`, but due to certain constraints, and in order to offer this course for free to everyone, the code you'll run here will use `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- You can use `gpt-4-turbo` when you run the notebook _locally_ (using `gpt-4-turbo` will not work on the platform)
- Thank you for your understanding!


```python
import os
from utils import get_openai_api_key,get_serper_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = get_serper_api_key()
```

## crewAI Tools


```python
from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool, SerperDevTool

# Initialize the tools
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
```

## Creating Agents


```python
# Agent 1: Venue Coordinator
venue_coordinator = Agent(
    role="Venue Coordinator",
    goal="Identify and book an appropriate venue "
    "based on event requirements",
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool],
    verbose=True,
    backstory=(
        "With a keen sense of space and "
        "understanding of event logistics, "
        "you excel at finding and securing "
        "the perfect venue that fits the event's theme, "
        "size, and budget constraints."
    )
)
```


```python
 # Agent 2: Logistics Manager
logistics_manager = Agent(
    role='Logistics Manager',
    goal=(
        "Manage all logistics for the event "
        "including catering and equipmen"
    ),
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool],
    verbose=True,
    backstory=(
        "Organized and detail-oriented, "
        "you ensure that every logistical aspect of the event "
        "from catering to equipment setup "
        "is flawlessly executed to create a seamless experience."
    )
)
```


```python
# Agent 3: Marketing and Communications Agent
marketing_communications_agent = Agent(
    role="Marketing and Communications Agent",
    goal="Effectively market the event and "
         "communicate with participants",
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool],
    verbose=True,
    backstory=(
        "Creative and communicative, "
        "you craft compelling messages and "
        "engage with potential attendees "
        "to maximize event exposure and participation."
    )
)
```

## Creating Venue Pydantic Object

- Create a class `VenueDetails` using [Pydantic BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/).
- Agents will populate this object with information about different venues by creating different instances of it.


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
# Define a Pydantic model for venue details 
# (demonstrating Output as Pydantic)
class VenueDetails(BaseModel):
    name: str
    address: str
    capacity: int
    booking_status: str
```

## Creating Tasks
- By using `output_json`, you can specify the structure of the output you want.
- By using `output_file`, you can get your output in a file.
- By setting `human_input=True`, the task will ask for human feedback (whether you like the results or not) before finalising it.


```python
venue_task = Task(
    description="Find a venue in {event_city} "
                "that meets criteria for {event_topic}.",
    expected_output="All the details of a specifically chosen"
                    "venue you found to accommodate the event.",
    human_input=True,
    output_json=VenueDetails,
    output_file="venue_details.json",  
      # Outputs the venue details as a JSON file
    agent=venue_coordinator
)
```

- By setting `async_execution=True`, it means the task can run in parallel with the tasks which come after it.


```python
logistics_task = Task(
    description="Coordinate catering and "
                 "equipment for an event "
                 "with {expected_participants} participants "
                 "on {tentative_date}.",
    expected_output="Confirmation of all logistics arrangements "
                    "including catering and equipment setup.",
    human_input=True,
    async_execution=True,
    agent=logistics_manager
)
```


```python
marketing_task = Task(
    description="Promote the {event_topic} "
                "aiming to engage at least"
                "{expected_participants} potential attendees.",
    expected_output="Report on marketing activities "
                    "and attendee engagement formatted as markdown.",
    async_execution=True,
    output_file="marketing_report.md",  # Outputs the report as a text file
    agent=marketing_communications_agent
)
```

## Creating the Crew

**Note**: Since you set `async_execution=True` for `logistics_task` and `marketing_task` tasks, now the order for them does not matter in the `tasks` list.


```python
# Define the crew with agents and tasks
event_management_crew = Crew(
    agents=[venue_coordinator, 
            logistics_manager, 
            marketing_communications_agent],
    
    tasks=[venue_task, 
           logistics_task, 
           marketing_task],
    
    verbose=True
)
```

## Running the Crew

- Set the inputs for the execution of the crew.


```python
event_details = {
    'event_topic': "Tech Innovation Conference",
    'event_description': "A gathering of tech innovators "
                         "and industry leaders "
                         "to explore future technologies.",
    'event_city': "San Francisco",
    'tentative_date': "2024-09-15",
    'expected_participants': 500,
    'budget': 20000,
    'venue_type': "Conference Hall"
}
```

**Note 1**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.

**Note 2**: 
- Since you set `human_input=True` for some tasks, the execution will ask for your input before it finishes running.
- When it asks for feedback, use your mouse pointer to first click in the text box before typing anything.


```python
result = event_management_crew.kickoff(inputs=event_details)
```

    Action: Search the internet
    Action Input: {"search_query": "Tech Innovation Conference 2025 details"}[0mThis is the agent final answer: After searching the internet, I found information related to catering and equipment setup for events at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. The hotel offers onsite catering services and has a document outlining the event menu. Additionally, they provide equipment setup services with a service charge for installation and removal. The hotel seems to have the necessary amenities and options for catering and equipment setup for events, making it a suitable choice for our event with 500 participants on 2024-09-15.
